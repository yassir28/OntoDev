# OntoDev
Reproduction of an ontology for invasion biology based on 11 hypotheses

## Classes production
by using OpenAPI I produced the classes as an initial step in ontology development. Refer to the get_entities file.

## Hierarchy of classes and scope
by using Bioportal's Api (refer to reuse_ontologies file), I produced a excel file (refer to the excel file) that has defnitions of classes from different ontologies with different contexts, parents and subclasses.

## OWL file (OWL and RDF)
I went through the production of the ontology using sketches I produced, which are based on definitions close to invasion biology context. This requires consultence of exprets which I havent conducted cos of scale of project (academic only). I instead based it on other onotlogies (other than INBIO because I wanted to reproduce without using that ontology) and common sense.

I used the sketches (refer to them in prentation in folder Report&presentation) to create the OWL file. (refer to .owx file)
